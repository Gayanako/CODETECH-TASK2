Overview of Student Grade Tracking and Management Program

Objective:
The objective of this Python program is to track and manage student grades for different subjects. The program allows users (teachers, administrators, etc.) to input grades for each student across multiple subjects, calculates the average grades, and displays the overall grade along with additional information such as letter grades and GPA (Grade Point Average).

Key Features:

Data Input:

The program allows users to input grades for each student and each subject or assignment.
Users can specify the number of subjects or assignments and input corresponding grades.
Calculation of Grades:

The program calculates the average grade for each student based on the grades entered.
It computes the overall grade by averaging the grades across all subjects or assignments.
Additional Information:

Letter Grade: Converts the average grade into a letter grade based on a standard grading scale (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).
GPA: Computes the GPA using a predefined scale
User Interface:

The program interacts with users through a command-line interface (CLI).
It provides prompts and messages to guide users through inputting grades and viewing results.
Error Handling:

Handles potential errors such as invalid input (non-numeric grades, incorrect format) gracefully.
Alerts users to any issues with the input and prevents calculation errors.
Modularity and Reusability:

Uses functions to encapsulate logic for grade calculation, GPA computation, and letter grade determination.
Promotes code readability and allows for easy maintenance and expansion.
